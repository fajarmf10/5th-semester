This Repo contains my college life, starting from the 5th semester and goes on. Hopefully i could update it frequently and helps me to be better on my file organizing skills.

I use SourceTree, GitKraken, Atom.io Text Editor, Sublime Text 3, XAMPP on Windows, WAMPP on Linux Ubuntu, Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition, Google Chrome, Java 8, Dev-C++ with MinGW, CodeBlocks with MinGW, Netbeans on Windows, Composer, and lot more as my developing tools.

I mainly code C/C++, PHP, and Python.
