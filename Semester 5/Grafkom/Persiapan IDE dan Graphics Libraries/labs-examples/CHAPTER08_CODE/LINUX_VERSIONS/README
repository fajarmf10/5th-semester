The examples in this directory show you how to have interactive menu.
In all the examples, clicking the middle mouse button should bring up
a menu. The user can select the limb of the robot to rotate. Clicking
the left or right mouse button would then rotate the selected limb.
On my laptop (Linux), I was not able to see the menu. Somehow the text of
the menu item has the same white colour as the background of the menu,
making it impossible to read the menu item text. However, if one knows
the ordering of the menu items on the menu, one can still select the
correct limb to rotate.

On the machines in the lab and on my desktop PC, I didn't encounter
any problem with the menu item text not showing up.
