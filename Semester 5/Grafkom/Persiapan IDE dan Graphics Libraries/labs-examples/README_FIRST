In 2015, I put in quite a fair bit of effort tidying up the code given
by the author Angel. Most of my work was for the Linux version of the
code. For some of the souce .cpp files, I put in comments to help explain
the code and I even added additional functionalities.

In 2016, I tidied up some of the code for the Mac version as well. In
particular, I fixed the errors in original Makefile in all the chapters'
directories. However, I did not have the time to repeat what I'd done last
year for the Mac version.  Students using the code in the MAC_VERSIONS
directory are thus suggested to look at the code in the LINUX_VERSIONS
directory as well.
